                    <p>Joining the police force is seen as a means of self-protection and access to privileges. Police
                        officers often justify their actions through the logic of appropriate behaviour, by considering
                        behaviours like levying informal fines on civilians for various transgressions as administration
                        of justice and inseparable from "maintaining social order".</p>
                    <p>Further, through the logic of victimization, police officers view themselves as the primary
                        victims of war, beleaguered by poverty and terrible living conditions. This allows them to
                        justify the practice of extortion and intimidation.</p>
